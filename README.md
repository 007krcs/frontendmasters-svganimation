All pens used in the slide lectures are in this [Codepen Collection](http://codepen.io/collection/XvBQJQ/).

Included in this repo are some very basic GSAP starter kits. 

##Part One, Section Three
There is a resource for the sprite and CSS animation SVG, should you need a starter resource.

##Part Two, Section Five
There are three directories you can use as GSAP starter kits:
* basic-tween
* basic-timeline
* master-timeline

##Part Two, Section Six
There are a few ways to work with the GSAP timeline in this file: gsap-resources.js. For any interaction with jQuery, remember to use the 3.0+ version. [Alpha](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.0.0-alpha1.js)
